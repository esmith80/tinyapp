Project: TinyURL
Author: Edward Smith
Date: Sept 4th, 2020

This is a project for Lighthouse Labs called TinyURL (v1.0). It is not entirely finished as of this writing (Sept 4th, 2020) but it does contain the base functionality as required by Lighthouse Labs TinyURL project specifications. 

It's not pretty, but it works (mostly).

It is a website which provides a user with the ability to create a short URL hyperlink that can be shared in place of the standard longer URL. This allows users to share things more easily on social media where characters are at a premium. The site has user authentication and a permission scheme whereby each user only sees TinyURLs for only their sites. 

The goal of further development is to move toward a one-page solution. Below is the future enhancement list, (no delivery date set):
- CSS to make the UI more vibrant and evenly spaced
- validation to ensure that text entered in the URL convertor is a valid url 
- controls on the urls listing page which will allow:
  - in-page editing of a url (this will replace the 'Edit' page)
  - creation of a new url (this will replace the 'Create' page)
- friendlier error messages after unsuccessful login/registration attempt
- share button to share the url to popular social media channels
- works on mobile and desktop
- on logout display goodbye message and then setTimeout to refresh to login screen
